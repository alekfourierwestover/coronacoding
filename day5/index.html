<p>Note: memoization means storing previously done computations to save in future computations</p>
<h1 id="problem-0">Problem 0</h1>
<p>Write a recursive program to compute Fibonacci numbers. Notice that it is trash. (What’s it’s running time?) Imrpove it a bit by using memoization.</p>
<h1 id="problem-0.6868">Problem 0.6868</h1>
<p>Write a program that does binary search. That is, given some sorted data, it can answer the query “what is the index of X / does X occur in the array” in time logarithmic in the array length.</p>
<h1 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h1>
<p>The powerset of a set is the set of all subsets of that set. More plainly, <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ B: B \subset A \}.\]</span> Write a recursive function and a non-recursie function to compute the powerset of a given set.</p>
<h1 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h1>
<p>The “edit distance” between 2 strings is the minimum number of deletions, insertions, and substitutions that it takes to transform one string into the other. Write a program that computes the minimum edit distance between two input strings.</p>
<h1 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h1>
<p>Download a list of the most common english words from the internet, and write a python script that replaces every word in some input text with a random word that is of minimal edit distance to it, but not of zero edit distance.</p>
<h1 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h1>
<p>There are 7 cents coins, 6 cents coins, and 8 cents coins. What is the fewest number of coins that you can use to get 692 coins?</p>
<h1 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h1>
<p>Write a program that determines the minimum distance between 2 vertices in a weighted graph.</p>
