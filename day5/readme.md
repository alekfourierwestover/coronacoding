# Problem 1
The powerset of a set is the set of all subsets of that set. More plainly, 
$$\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ B: B \subset A \}.$$
Write a recursive function and a non-recursie function to compute the powerset of a given set.

# Problem 2
The "edit distance" between 2 strings is the minimum number of deletions, insertions, and substitutions that it takes to transform one string into the other. Write a program that computes the minimum edit distance between two input strings.

# Problem 3
Download a list of the most common english words from the internet, and write a python script that replaces every word in some input text with a random word that is of minimal edit distance to it, but not of zero edit distance.
